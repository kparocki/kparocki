# You are probably wondering if I can do any coding... ‚å®Ô∏è
I sure can. I know the most basic programming language currently in existence - **python** - along with its Data Science libraries **pandas**, **numpy** and **matplotlib**.

### But does it get any better than that?
Well, statistical gimmicks were also revealed to me. I can **bootstrap** a dataset for you. I can tell you what **degrees of freedom** are. I can convince you why **normal distributions** are so useful by animating **the central limit theorem**. All of that in **R Studio**.

If you are math-savvy, I can optimize a constrained multivariate function using **the Lagrangian** on an old-school blackboard.

I also know **Excel** in-depth because

Did you know that you can compile a 3D globe in this software? Now you know.
  
### Are you learning something? 
I learn something all the time. A couple of days ago I learnt that the Republic of Karelia belonged to Finland up until the Winter War (1940). It's almost the size of Finland we know today!
  
Oh, yes, IT-wise?
  
* Machine Learning models (don't ask me about that yet)
* SQL (ask my about that already)
  
### Any hobbies?
üí†Glad you askedüí†
  
Ever wondered how to win a Deity (hardcore) difficulty level in Civilization V? 
No?
Doesn't matter, I will show you anyway.

# Wondering if I can do any coding?
I sure can. I know the most basic programming language currently in existence - **python** - along with its basic Data Science libraries **pandas**, **numpy** and **matplotlib**.

### But does it get any better than that?
Well, statistical gimmicks were also revealed to me. I can **bootstrap** a dataset for you. I can tell you what **degrees of freedom** are. I can convince you why **normal distributions** are so useful by animating **the central limit theorem**. All of that in **R Studio**.

If you are math-savvy, I can optimize a constrained multivariate function using **the Lagrangian** on an old-school blackboard.

I also know **Excel** in-depth because

Did you know that you can compile a 3D globe in this software? Now you know.
  
### Are you learning something? 
I learn something all the time. A couple of days ago I learnt that the Republic of Karelia belonged to Finland up until the Winter War (1940). It was almost the size of Finland we know today!
  
Oh, yes, IT-wise?
  
* Machine Learning models (don't ask me about that yet)
* SQL (ask my about that already)
  
### Any hobbies?

Ever wondered how to win a Deity (hardcore) difficulty level in Civilization V? 
No?
Doesn't matter, I will show you anyway.
  
For those unaware, deity is the highest difficulty that can be played in Civilization V. On this difficulty, the AI recieves massive bonuses to happiness, culture, faith, production and gold. They also get the 4 initial techs researched on turn 1. Basically the AI has more of everything than the player, and you, just have to deal with it and outclass them by being smarter than them.

The key to deity, and in fact to any victory in Civilization V, is the science output. You can achieve this by managing your scientist slots, and better managing your city growth and buildings.

Most of the time, it is best to go for a Tall empire (few High Population cities) as opposed to a Wide empire (lots of medium pop cities). Tall empires will allow you yo lock your specialist slots in most if not all cities. It will also make happiness easier to handle, while still providing you with High Production and Gold, allowing you to remain flexible and competitive with other Civilizations on the manufacturing side of things.

As you could imagine, your early game in civ will shape your entire game. So play it well.

#### Scouts
Scouts are pretty weak, but they are quick and very handy on maps with a lot of land. Scouts will allow you to get to Ancient Ruins before the AI. Building Scouts should therefore be your top priority in the first few turns. As Such, I always tend to build 2 scouts, granting me 3 units to explore with by turn 10-12 if I count my warrior. This will allow you to find some good city locations that will serve your greatly when you start to expand your empire.

#### Technologies
Whatever your starting location might be, coastal, grasslands, hills, 90% of the time you will want to research Pottery first. Getting access to the Shrine as early as possible will allow you to maybe get a very good pantheon, which could give you the advantage you need to beat a deity AI. I tend to build a shrine as soon as my 2nd scout is done.

Don't bother trying yo rush the Great Library, on Immortal/Deity, the AI will usually finish building it long before you even research writing. 

Faith is sometimes neglected because it is very hard to actually get a religion on deity, but trust me, in the late game, you're going to want to be sitting on 1 to 2.5k faith. Being able to purchase great people with faith, especially engineers, will allow you to speed up the construction of some key late wonders and get them before your competitors.

As for what comes next technology-wise, prioritize researching technologies that will allow you to connect your luxury resources first, than your strategic resources. You need to connect these very fast in order to keep your hapiness high enough for you to expand. Trade extra luxury's for flat gold when possible or for other luxuries should you need the happiness. (As a quick reminder, on Standard speed, luxury's can be sold to the AI for 240 flat gold or 7 gold per turn. Strategic resources can be sold 45 flat gold. --> This gold must be used to purchase library's in your lowest production cities that you may have just founded, or buy some archer units which you will need to repel invasions.

Once again there is no fixed way to do it. The main thing is to get your luxuries connected ASAP, and to start researching Philosphy before too long. You want to be able to get your National College around turn 100 on Standard Speed. The quicker the better.

#### Culture
Going full Tradition works well on deity. As mentioned before, being able to purchase Engineers with faith, while giving your empire a growth and happiness boost is really good and allows great playstyle flexibility.

Having finished tradition, you should start having a fairly strong empire, thanks to good growth in your cities. This will help you most on the long run, as high pop cities mean lots of science.

#### Early Game

Build a worker before your first settler, you want to get those luxuries online ASAP. Start improving luxuries that give production with your worker first (Gold or Silver for instance). Since your city stops growing when you produce your settler, you'll be able to switch all your city work tiles to full production ones. As such, improving tiles that will give additional production will always be helpful when you build your settler. Chopping forests also works to speed up your settler construction time.

When you expand, try to get cities at a reasonable distance from your capital, if possible with access to luxury resources you don't have or will be able to trade with other civs. Mountains are useful for observatories and that will be a big deal science-wise. If your capital is coastal, I'de advise you to get 1 or 2 other coastal cities, as Food Cargo ships to your capital will do great good on the growth side of things.

I would advise you to hard build libraries in your first 3 cities and purchase one in your 4th one. This will allow you to get started on National College in a pretty efficient and speedy way. Once National College is done, devote your research to getting to Education as fast as possible. You want to get Universities' specialist slots ASAP, so you may get universities which greatly boost your science output (+8 base science, add the 50% from Observatoris, national college, research lab and the 33% from universities and you get a lot of extra science !)

Use Trade routes for High Science and Gold.

#### Mid to Late Game

Keep your cities growing, produce a reasonable enough army for defense purposes, 6 to 7 crossbowmen should do the trick for a 4 city empire. Once you get universities done in every city, you gain a lot more flexibility in the game, slowly but surely, you'll catch up the AI in technologies (which the early game in deity is all about) and eventually, you'll eclipse them (if you have good well timed research agreement).

I would advise you to go for Rationalism as well. The AI doesn't build the Porcelain Tower and if you get 2 or 3 research agreements, you will progress through techs way way way faster than the AI. If you play clever the early-mid game, you should be ahead of most civs in techs by the Modern Era, and you should be the first to enter Atomic and Information eras.

Get Observatories as soon as possible in cities next to mountains, get your public schools and your research labs online fast. The more scientist slots available the better. Even if you're going for a cultural victory, you want to get the highest science output possible. More science means quicker access to wonders, and on deity, you want to be able to build wonders before the AI gets the required tech. Or you will simply not stand a chance to actually build the wonder.

Finally to conclude, I would like to insist on the importance of having a reasonable size army throughout the game. If you are weak, the AI will destroy you, and as far as I know, the only way you have a chance to fight a war against a deity AI is to have a good amount of units yourself. Ranged units are key, as mentioned before. Obviously on Sea focussed maps, you want to get a powerful navy.

Are you still there? Yes? Oh, wow. That's perseverence. Know therefore that I didn't write the above myself (I'm not a masochist to write an entire essay for a GitHub intro). It's [a guide I found on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/26m17h/a_guide_to_deity_bnw/), which I follow for most of my games, and it works quite well.
